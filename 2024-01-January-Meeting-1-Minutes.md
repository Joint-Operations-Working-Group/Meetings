#### JuliaCon 2024 Proposal-A-Thon
<i>The JuliaCon 2024 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee is excited to announce a presentation and office hours event for writing your JuliaCon 2024 proposal! If you are curious about the process of writing and submitting a proposal (you donâ€™t need an idea yet!), we encourage you to attend! The event will start with a presentation on the process, followed by office hours where you can ask individual questions. We welcome a range of questions, such as: Should I submit a talk or a poster? Is X a good proposal topic? Is my proposal missing anything? How are proposals reviewed?
