#### 1. Global R User Groups

Website: https://www.meetup.com/globalr/

Global R User Group is dedicated for organisers and co-organisers of R meetup groups in order to bring them together. 
This allows us as organisers to share event information between us which then enables us to inform our individual local groups that we manage.
As organisers of R meetup groups our aim is to offer our members the opportunity to attend online events about the R programming language that are taking place around the world. Our goal is for our members to have more opportunities to share their experiences using R as well as support the global R community.

#### 6. Hiatus of Why R? Foundation

* Senior Officers of the Why R? Foundation expressed the intention to close the Why R? Foundation as a legal entity.
* The officers are open to the idea of the transfer of the name and digit assets to a successor organization, provided that this successor organization is run according to the similar procedures, values, ethics and conventions of the original Why R? organization.

**Main Points**
* Functioning on a not-for-profit basis.
  -  The organization will continue to refrain from commercial activities
* Run events and meetups for the promotion of R for Science and Research
  - SatRdays / Why R? Meetups / UseR! Regional events
* Advancing the careers of career-young data scientists who use R all over the world
* Provision of Operational Support (like Zoom Accounts) for RUGs
* Promoting the use of Open Source Software 
 - The organization will be mostly R focussed, but not exclusively R focussed - and may support projects where R is not used
* Assisting Non-for-Profit and Volunteer entities in activities adjacent to the R in the pursuit of their activities
* Collaborate with organizations with similar goals 
 - Collaborate with the OSGEO / FOSS4G organizations
