### 4. Templates for Conference Presenations

* Design of accessibility-friendly slide presentations for Talks
* Additional consideration for templates is the black text on white backgrounds are not suitable for stills photography. 
* "Black-Text-On-White-Background" slides come out very pporly in photographs.
	 - undermining the choice of shots that can be used to record the conference.
	 - Can disguise poor attendance in a talk, by using closeup shots, but only if slides can be properly photographed.

* Daneile Procida spoke out against the decision
